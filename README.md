##  ASSIGNMENT

Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia. E.g. Suits (see table just above the References)

Then create a short report (you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task) that contains, for example:

(do a commit after each step!)

    A brief description of the show (use italics for names).
    A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
    A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
    A graph of the viewership over time.
    A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
    A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by insert_calculated_number between seasons 3 and 5).
    Make sure your report looks nice -> this time weâ€™re mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
    ender your report and save it in the relevant folder of your repo.
