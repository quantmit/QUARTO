#   2 Assignment

Open the Assignment.qmd file (and the .html for reference). Take a look.

It loads up data for Season 1 of Game of Thrones, then creates some short summary on that basis.

We have data for eight seasons though!

So: modify the Assignment file to turn it into an automated report that takes data as input.

It should then create a separate document for each season.

    Use params.
    You can refer to the files in the Data folder as input (you could actually write web scraping code in code chunks, that would grab this info from Wikipedia as you render).
    Change the relevant numbers, names, descriptions, etc. in the text so that the report includes info for the correct season
    If you get that far, do a loop with render() to quickly create 8 reports in pdfs.
