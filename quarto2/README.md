# QUARTO2
##  200~ssignment

Get your TV show description file from the previous week. Modify it using what we’ve learned today:

    Render it into at least two different formats in an automated way (e.g. using YAML options or a script).

    Add some features for the .html output, e.g.: add a table of contents and change the theme.

    Include tabs.

    Browse through the documentation and pick additional configuration options on your own.

Note: if you didn’t finish the assignment last week, you can work with the Assignment.Rmd file. You’ll have to convert it to .qmd first though (use what we’ve learned today for that!)
